# Non-Default Specialist Skill Library

Root `skills/` stores specialist guidance that should remain referenceable but
should not be default-loaded as an active oasis7 skill entrypoint.

Use this surface for:

- professional method skills referenced by role cards
- retired or conditional specialist skills
- channel-specific playbooks and analysis guides
- upstream or long-form reference material that should not trigger by default

Default-loadable repo-owned skill entrypoints live under `.agents/skills/`.
Promoting material from `skills/` back into the default surface requires a
source-of-truth-first workflow change, README/role-card sync, and
`./scripts/lint-skills.sh`.

- `agent-browser`: browser automation reference for Web/viewer evidence.
