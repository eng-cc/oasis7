# Memory Management

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- a game/runtime task touches allocations, pooling, GC pressure, asset streaming, or platform memory budgets
- performance work needs memory profiling or memory-budget guidance
- a slice must reason about memory regressions or memory-related frame stutter

Do not use this skill when:

- the task is CPU/GPU performance without meaningful memory behavior
- the task is general Rust ownership cleanup without a runtime memory goal

## Core Workflow

1. Define the target platform, budget, and symptom before changing memory behavior.
2. Read `references/full-guidance.md` for pooling, GC, profiling, streaming, and checklist details.
3. Prefer measured baselines and post-change measurements over intuition.

## Supporting Files

- `references/full-guidance.md`: detailed original guidance, examples, patterns, and command/reference material.

## Oasis7-Specific Surfaces

- runtime/performance profiling evidence
- asset loading or pooling code touched by the task
- `references/full-guidance.md` detailed patterns

## Known Failure Modes

- Pooling can hide leaks or stale state if reset semantics are incomplete.
- Lower allocation count is not automatically lower memory footprint; measure peak and steady-state separately.
- Streaming fixes can move stalls to IO or decode boundaries if prefetch timing is not verified.

## Guardrails

- Keep this entrypoint concise; move heavy examples or catalog material to supporting files.
- Do not bypass oasis7 task/worktree truth or professional role ownership when the workflow requires it.
- Do not present reference material as verified project behavior without checking the current repo state.

## Verification

- Run the relevant memory/performance profile or focused regression command.
- Run `./scripts/lint-skills.sh` after skill edits.
