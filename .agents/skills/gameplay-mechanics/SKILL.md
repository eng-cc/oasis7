# Gameplay Mechanics

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- a task changes player verbs, mechanics, resource loops, combat, movement, progression, or balance behavior
- mechanic implementation needs feedback-loop, event, or tuning guidance
- a gameplay_designer or gameplay implementation slice needs reusable mechanics reference material

Do not use this skill when:

- the request is only high-level product strategy or architecture documentation
- the task is visual/UI presentation without changing gameplay rules or player verbs

## Core Workflow

1. Route through the appropriate professional gameplay slice before presenting gameplay conclusions.
2. Read `references/full-guidance.md` for detailed mechanics patterns, code examples, balance loops, and troubleshooting.
3. Tie each mechanic change to an observable player-facing behavior and a verification command or playtest note.

## Supporting Files

- `references/full-guidance.md`: detailed original guidance, examples, patterns, and command/reference material.

## Oasis7-Specific Surfaces

- `.agents/roles/gameplay_designer.md`
- `doc/game/project.md`
- gameplay/runtime tests or playtest evidence for changed mechanics

## Known Failure Modes

- A mechanic that compiles can still feel wrong; include feedback timing and player-readable state in acceptance.
- Balance changes without instrumentation or replayable scenarios are hard to verify later.
- Avoid changing economy/progression constants without documenting the expected player impact.

## Guardrails

- Keep this entrypoint concise; move heavy examples or catalog material to supporting files.
- Do not bypass oasis7 task/worktree truth or professional role ownership when the workflow requires it.
- Do not present reference material as verified project behavior without checking the current repo state.

## Verification

- Run the focused gameplay/runtime test or playtest harness tied to the mechanic.
- Run `./scripts/lint-skills.sh` after skill edits.
