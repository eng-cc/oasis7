# Public-testnet governance trust-root provisioning

The clean-room adapter consumes one structured JSON trust-root artifact. The
artifact is not a caller-selected identity and is not a replacement for the
independent provenance verifier. It is a deployment-bound regular file at:

`/operator/truth/governance-root.json`

The repository fixture is the schema and canonical-digest contract:

`scripts/fixtures/oasis7-governance-root.v1.json`

For the governed fixture deployment, provision the exact fixture bytes as the
code-owned path, then enforce the operator-local ownership contract:

```sh
mkdir -p /operator/truth
install -o "$(id -u)" -g "$(id -g)" -m 0600 \
  scripts/fixtures/oasis7-governance-root.v1.json \
  /operator/truth/governance-root.json
if command -v shasum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  shasum -a 256 /operator/truth/governance-root.json
else
  sha256sum /operator/truth/governance-root.json
fi
```

The `mkdir` step must create only the governed parent path; do not replace the
artifact with a symlink or copy it from another node. `shasum -a 256` is the
portable macOS/Linux spelling when available, with `sha256sum` retained for
minimal Linux images.

For this fixture the expected file digest is
`f278bc8f060cd6777d68f086fc3131edc5d6b5a6080bde09208ba69a69e3ef66`; the
embedded canonical `root_digest` is
`5abd00f3e90a3e894f110f5a32ecab772e23e97ad7ec2cc9d675ae65282ae8ab`.

The adapter pins both the file SHA-256 and the semantic `root_digest` computed
by the repository provenance helper. It also rejects a symlink in the file or
any ancestor. `owner_scope=operator-local` means the account executing the
adapter must own the regular file; the numeric UID is deployment-local and is
never supplied by a plan or authority envelope. The fixture's public-key
values are non-secret test material and must not be treated as production
signing credentials.

## Full-network clean-room execution lock

The adapter fixes one shared fleet-lock path:
`/operator/truth/full-network-clean-room.lock`. Provision its parent directory
for the operator account running the adapter; the immediate parent must be
owned by that account and not group/other writable. The lock must be an
operator-owned regular file with mode `0600`, with no symlink in its path or
ancestors. The helper can create a missing parent/lock, but this does not waive
the ownership/mode checks or grant deployment authority. Do not remove,
replace, rename or rotate the lock or parent while an execution is active.

Both `execute` and `resume_transaction` acquire the fleet lock first, then the
per-journal `<journal>.lock`, using nonblocking exclusive `flock`. Contention
fails closed; choosing a different journal or transaction ID cannot bypass
the common lock on the same execution host. Failure to acquire the journal
lock releases the fleet lock. Both remain held through provider callbacks,
recovery and durable completion, and release in reverse order on exit. The
guards recheck held descriptor/path and immediate-parent identities, ownership
and modes around callbacks and before guarded journal effects; detected drift
blocks further effects. The durable lock files remain after release.

This is a local shared-filesystem execution lock, not a distributed lease or
multi-host authority service. Separate operator machines with separate lock
files are not serialized; independently governed deployment coordination must
ensure a single execution authority. `flock` and pathname checks do not isolate
the process from arbitrary hostile same-UID writers. Unsupported locking or
an unverifiable lock binding fails closed.

The adapter also revalidates the live governance-root file before destructive
mutation and before each recovery re-observation/clean-redeploy callback,
including after external verification and the admitted-scope journal write.
Missing, replaced, digest-drifted or metadata-invalid root evidence blocks the
next callback; a prior successful check is not continuing authority. These
checks do not extend capture/no-backup leases or remove the identity-v2
production capability blockers below.

## Identity-v2 admission profile (not provisioned)

Identity-v2 is a separate signing domain and authority profile. It does not
reuse the rebuild-proof signer, a node-consensus key, or the fixture keys
above. The profile may be activated only after a governance-root-approved
deployment record authorizes it; writing a tool or a digest does not grant
signer authority. This profile is currently **NOT PROVISIONED / CAPABILITY
BLOCKED**. No live provider, private key, credential, node, or production
identity configuration is created by this document.

### Managed peer registry (not provisioned)

The shared `scripts/p2p-public-testnet-peer-registry.py` loader fixes the path
`/operator/truth/managed-peer-registry.json`. Its independent `REGISTRY_SHA256`
pin is currently `None`; admission fails closed until separately approved
deployment authority provisions the exact bytes and pin. There is no CLI,
environment, receipt or caller-inventory override, and no synthetic or
historical-peer fallback. Historical four-node topology evidence does not
establish current identities or supply the missing verified Windows identity.

The exact schema is `oasis7.managed_peer_registry.v1`, with fields
`schema_version`, `network_id`, `registry_epoch`, and `nodes`. The network is
`oasis7-public-testnet-governed-20260606`. Each of exactly five nodes has only
`node_name`, `node_id`, and `peer_id`; names and node IDs must match the shared
loader's canonical five-node set, and peer IDs must be unique. Provisioning
requires independent current evidence for every tuple, including Windows,
and governance approval of the complete snapshot and its rotation epoch.
Do not copy test fixtures or infer peer IDs from names, logs or old documents.

The loader requires an operator-owned regular file, mode `0600` on POSIX,
rejects path symlinks except the fixed `/var` and `/tmp` system aliases, reads
through `O_NOFOLLOW`, and compares file identity before/after reading plus the
exact SHA-256 pin. Every ancestor must stat successfully as a directory owned
by root or the operator account. Group/other write bits are rejected except
on root-owned sticky directories; a foreign-owned directory is rejected even
with mode `0755`. The fixed `/var` and `/tmp` aliases still undergo these
directory ownership/write-mode checks after resolution. Stat failures and
non-directory ancestors fail closed before the registry is read. These
pre/post checks do not claim atomic protection against a hostile same-owner
process replacing and restoring paths between checks. All output alias guards
also protect the registry and its shared loader source.

The full-five-node `oasis7.clean_room_plan_intent.v2` includes
`peer_registry_sha256` and `peer_registry_epoch`; both are covered by its signed
canonical digest and compared with current registry authority. Registry epoch
is separate from signing-key `rotation_epoch`. A changed digest or epoch
invalidates old intent/map/plan and resume admission, including a registry
rotation retaining the same peer tuples. Intent v1 has no silent migration:
fresh governed context/intent/signatures/evidence are required. These software
checks neither provision authority nor establish current node health, provider
custody or release readiness.

The deployment must reserve these code-owned paths before activation:

| artifact | deployment path | independent admission requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| governance root | `/operator/truth/governance-root.json` | The fixed regular file and semantic `root_digest` must match the independently pinned governance-root values above. |
| identity-v2 trust config | `/operator/truth/identity-v2-trust-config.json` | Exact file SHA-256 is pinned by deployment authority under the governance root; the caller may assert this path but may not select another path or supply the pin. |
| provider registry | `/operator/truth/identity-v2-provider-registry.json` | Exact registry bytes and digest are pinned by deployment authority under the governance root; `provider-ref` selects only a non-secret allowlisted ID. |
| independent verifier | path recorded by the provider registry | The executable must be a deployment-owned regular executable with an independently pinned SHA-256; a self-reported digest or caller command/endpoint is not evidence. |

The identity-v2 trust config must use the exact schema
`oasis7.identity_v2_trust_config.v1` and fields `schema_version`, `network_id`,
`trust_root_id`, `verifier_id`, `algorithm`, `rotation_epoch`, `allowlist`,
and `revocations`. Each allowlist entry binds one immutable `signer_id` to a
public-only `public_key_ref`, its `public_key_sha256`, status, and validity
interval. Public key replacement requires a new signer identity. The exact
`revocations` entries contain `signer_id`, `effective_at`, and `reason`; issuer
and replacement metadata, where required by the governance ledger, must be
recorded outside the caller-supplied input. Unknown or stale revocation state
blocks current admission.

Current admission additionally requires the envelope, context, provider
attestation, and this pinned trust config to share the exact current
`rotation_epoch`. A non-current epoch is not current authority; historical
audit remains forensic-only and must be justified by the separate historical
trust ledger at its consuming boundary.

The provider registry must bind each approved provider ID to its signer,
public-key digest, Ed25519 algorithm, authenticated custody adapter, adapter
SHA-256, and the verifier executable/digest. The registry's trust-config digest
is a consistency check, not the independent root of trust: the deployment
authority must pin the registry and trust-config bytes separately under the
governance root. No registry entry may expose a private-key path, secret,
endpoint, arbitrary command, or credential.

The identity-v2 filesystem policy is intentionally narrower than an
owner-only-secret policy. Every trust-config, registry, public-key, adapter,
and verifier artifact must be a regular non-symlink file owned by the
operator-local account that runs admission. Ancestors must be owned by root or
that admission account. Group/other write bits are forbidden on artifacts and
ancestors, except for root-owned sticky ancestor directories.
Ancestor symlinks are rejected except for the fixed `/var` and `/tmp` system
aliases used on macOS. Public metadata and public keys
may remain readable (for example, `0644` is valid when no non-owner write bit
is present), while adapter and verifier files must have the owner execute bit.
The tool reads these artifacts through `O_NOFOLLOW` descriptors and binds
pre/post `fstat` metadata; provider/verifier executable digests are checked
again after their subprocess returns before any caller output is promoted.
The sidecar records the registry-selected verifier's initial protected file
identity and rechecks that identity, protected metadata, and pinned digest
immediately before and after verifier execution, before promoting evidence.
These protected reads and pre/post checks do not guarantee atomic execution
against a hostile same-owner process that replaces and restores an executable
between checks. Applying `0600` to every public artifact is not required by
this contract.

The provider receipt must use the implemented v2 contract:
`oasis7.identity_v2_provider_attestation.v2` has the exact top-level fields
`schema_version`, `network_id`, `provider_id`, `request_id`, `signer_id`,
`public_key_sha256`, `algorithm`, `canonical_payload_sha256`,
`signature_sha256`, `context_digest`, `rotation_epoch`, `capture_window_id`,
`issued_at`, `expires_at`, `task_uid`, `head_oid`, `proof_ref`, and `proof`.
The nested `proof` is exactly
`oasis7.identity_v2_provider_authentication_proof.v1` with
`schema_version`, `algorithm`, `claims_sha256`, and `signature_hex`; its
domain-separated claims bind the request, provider/key, payload/signature,
context, task/HEAD, rotation/window, issue/expiry, and proof reference. The
same pinned provider public key verifies both payload and proof signatures.
`req-v2:<64 lowercase hex>` is a CSPRNG challenge and
`proof-v1:<64 lowercase hex>` is a bounded reference; these format checks do
not prove entropy or exclude covert data.

Identity-v2 artifacts and their ancestors must satisfy the filesystem policy
above, including its explicit ancestor exceptions, before use. The governance
root uses its separate file and ancestor checks; the identity-v2 ancestor
write-mode checks above do not describe governance-root enforcement. Identity-v2 verification
must bind the exact raw-v1 bytes, context digest, pre-receipt plan-intent
digest, task, frozen HEAD, node/peer tuple, capture window, rotation, and
trust-config/provider-registry/verifier digests. A receipt with
`mode=historical_audit` is forensic only (`historical_only=true`,
`apply_authorized=false`), even when a retired key was valid at issuance;
destructive apply requires a fresh `current_admission` receipt with
`apply_authorized=true` and an independent current-authority recheck.

The sidecar bridge now invokes the four fixed commands and independently calls
the verifier seam, but deployment trust-config, registry, and verifier pin
values remain unset here. With `--evidence-dir`, it atomically retains the
context, plan-intent, and seven per-node artifacts (`raw_v1`,
`prepare_manifest`, `payload`, `provider_attestation`, `unsigned_envelope`,
`signed_envelope`, and `verification`) as owner-only regular files. The
descriptor records only path, SHA-256, and size. The provider-attestation
object has an exact field allowlist, but the detached-proof value/content
sensitivity remains a provider/runtime diagnosis; credentials, private keys,
and raw command output must not be placed in retained evidence. A sidecar emits a one-node
`oasis7.identity_v2_evidence_map.v2`; the implemented
`scripts/p2p-public-testnet-identity-v2-evidence-aggregate.py` accepts exactly
five one-node maps, enforces common task/HEAD/context/intent and canonical node
bindings, and re-runs planner validation before atomically writing the
five-node map.

The planner requires `--identity-v2-evidence-map`; every adapter invocation
carrying identity-v2 inputs, including `--apply`, must carry that exact map with
`--identity-v2-mode current_admission`. The gate rejects before execute,
provenance, journal, ledger, lock, or provider work unless both are present;
the current map bridge remains validation-only and grants no apply authority. The
offline implementation has no provider-side durable one-shot replay authority:
fresh request/proof identifiers and map uniqueness do not prove provider
consumption. A deployment-authorized replay ledger/audit is still required before
production admission. The
validator-pair executor still has no v2 production admission input. Operators
must not add guessed CLI flags or pass identity-v2 material through the legacy
identity-receipts input. Synthetic fake-provider/transport or test-only
module-cache harness receipts are orphan evidence and do not prove deployed
custody, trust anchors, verifier pins, node health, or release readiness. The
governed bootstrap runbook documents the software interface as a
capability-gated prerequisite, not as evidence that production provisioning
has occurred.
