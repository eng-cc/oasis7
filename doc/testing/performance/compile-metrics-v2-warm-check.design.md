This document defines the technical contract for the approved first Compile
Metrics V2 slice: an opt-in warm/no-op `cargo check` measurement. It is a
design authority, not a task ledger. Task status, execution evidence, review
returns, and mutable acceptance state remain in the GitHub task issue.

## 1. Purpose and scope

The current compile-metrics harness answers a cold-build question: how much
dependency closure and wall-clock work is required to check a selected Cargo
surface from an isolated run-owned target directory outside the checkout? The
first V2 slice adds one
deliberately narrower question:

> After the cold check has completed, how long does an identical no-op check
> take when it reuses the same checkout's run-owned check target directory
> outside the checkout?

The warm metric is useful for detecting the cost of the ordinary developer or
agent inner loop when no source has changed. It does not claim to measure a
touched-source incremental rebuild, and it does not by itself prove that any
optimization made compilation faster.

The slice is intentionally bounded to:

- one optional `cargo check` immediately after the existing cold check;
- the same selected package, feature mode, offline/locked flags, normalized
  environment, and per-checkout run-owned check target directory outside the
  checkout as the cold check;
- current-only or current-versus-baseline JSON/Markdown reporting;
- an optional, explicitly supplied warm regression threshold;
- contract tests for command identity, target isolation, source immutability,
  schema identity, and fail-closed gate behavior.

The existing cold metrics, launcher `wasmtime` invariant, required-gate
planner, and default workflow behavior remain unchanged.

## 2. Current facts and evidence boundary

These facts describe the repository surfaces that the target contract extends;
they are not a claim that the warm option is already implemented.

| Surface | Current behavior | Consequence for V2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci-compile-metrics.sh` | Measures one offline/locked `cargo check` per checkout, plus an optional release build and binary size. It counts one forward dependency tree and records commit OIDs, package identity, feature mode, and metric values. | `cargo_check_seconds` must remain the cold value. The warm value needs a distinct field and an identity bit. |
| Cargo target isolation | Current and baseline check builds use separate temporary target directories. Check and release builds are also separated. `CARGO_HOME` may be shared for registry/source data. | Warm reuse must happen only within one checkout's existing run-owned check target directory outside the checkout; current and baseline must never share target outputs. |
| Measurement environment | Cargo calls normalize `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, development/test debug settings, and an unset `RUSTC_WRAPPER`. Timed check/build commands run `--offline --locked` after host-target prefetch. | The warm check must use the same normalization and must not introduce network or wrapper-dependent timing. |
| `.github/workflows/compile-metrics.yml` | `workflow_dispatch` runs a three-platform matrix. `baseline_ref` is optional. Thresholds are manual string inputs; cold gates run only when a baseline is available. | Warm measurement is an opt-in manual input. It does not become an automatic PR trigger or a new required check in this slice. |
| `ci-compile-metrics-gate.py` | Validates measurement identity, commit provenance, unique known metric rows, finite non-negative values, arithmetic, and configured cold thresholds. | Warm identity and row validation must use the same fail-closed rules. No implicit warm threshold may be added. |
| Performance matrix | Compile metrics are currently `on-demand`; the documented gap is cold-only coverage and the cost/noise of three-platform paired runs. | The matrix should point to this design and state that warm/no-op remains opt-in/report-only unless a threshold is explicitly supplied. |

The current harness has no touched-source incremental scenario. A warm/no-op
result must never be presented as evidence for `touch-proto`, `touch-node`,
`touch-launcher-ui`, or `touch-wasm-abi`; those are future scenarios described
in Section 11.

## 3. Non-goals and invariants

### 3.1 Non-goals

This slice does not:

- change Cargo dependencies, feature definitions, package boundaries, or
  runtime behavior;
- enable `sccache`, `RUSTC_WRAPPER`, incremental compilation, or debug info in
  the cold metric;
- change the required-gate changed-path planner or add an automatic pull
  request trigger;
- add a default warm threshold, claim a stable SLO, or make warm timing a
  release-blocking signal by default;
- split libp2p features, add workspace dependency governance, add a fast
  linker profile, or introduce `cargo-nextest`;
- measure a source mutation, a touched-file rebuild, a release-link warm path,
  or a cross-checkout shared target;
- copy task status, mutable evidence, or a task execution ledger into this
  document.

### 3.2 Invariants

1. Cold `cargo check` remains the first timed check and retains its current
   command, per-checkout run-owned target directory outside the checkout,
   environment, and gate semantics.
2. Warm measurement is opt-in and is never silently substituted for a missing
   cold measurement.
3. Warm and cold checks for one checkout use the same run-owned check target
   directory outside the checkout, while current and baseline check targets
   remain different.
4. Current and baseline warm-mode identity must match before a comparison can
   be used for threshold evaluation.
5. A source/worktree mutation during measurement fails the run closed; it is
   not converted into a successful warm result.
6. A missing, malformed, non-finite, or semantically inconsistent warm field
   cannot satisfy an explicitly requested warm threshold.

## 4. Target contract: option and workflow inputs

### 4.1 Harness option

Add the opt-in CLI flag:

```text
--measure-warm-check
```

When absent, the harness preserves the current one-check behavior and emits a
warm-disabled result according to Section 6. When present, each measured
checkout runs the warm check after its cold check.

The option applies to both check-only surfaces and release-build surfaces. A
release-build surface still measures the warm check around `cargo check`; its
release build remains a separate cold operation in its own per-checkout
run-owned release target directory outside the checkout.

### 4.2 Manual workflow inputs

The manual workflow exposes the same choice with these inputs:

| Input | Type/default | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `measure_warm_check` | boolean / `false` | Passes the opt-in flag to the harness for current and baseline measurements. |
| `max_cargo_check_warm_regression_pct` | string / empty | Optional non-negative finite percentage. It is passed to the gate only when supplied and warm measurement is enabled. |

The existing cold threshold inputs retain their names, defaults, and meaning.
The warm threshold has no default value. Supplying a warm threshold while
`measure_warm_check` is false is a configuration error and must fail before a
gate can report success; silently ignoring that threshold would make the
workflow claim ambiguous.

Before baseline fetch, measurement, or gate evaluation, the workflow runs an
unconditional input-validation step for every `workflow_dispatch` invocation;
it is not guarded by whether a baseline ref was supplied. The step validates
the choice input, parses every non-empty cold or warm threshold as a finite,
non-negative number, and rejects a supplied warm threshold when
`measure_warm_check` is false. The same validation is not deferred to the
baseline-conditional gate step, because otherwise invalid or contradictory
inputs could appear successful on a current-only run.

When no baseline is provided, the workflow may still collect and publish the
current warm value. As with current cold-only runs, no regression threshold is
evaluated without baseline metrics. The gate invocation therefore has a
current-only path after measurement (or an equivalent explicit no-baseline
step), and emits a visible `SKIP` result naming the selected threshold(s) that
were not evaluated. The summary must repeat that no-baseline distinction; it
must not look like a passing threshold verdict.

## 5. Measurement order and cold/warm isolation

For each checkout (`current`, then `baseline` when requested), the harness
follows this order:

```text
host-target prefetch (not timed)
  -> dependency-tree query (not timed)
  -> cold cargo check in the per-checkout run-owned <label>-check-target
     directory outside the checkout (timed)
  -> identical warm/no-op cargo check in that same external target directory
     (timed)
  -> optional release cargo build in the separate per-checkout run-owned
     <label>-release-target directory outside the checkout (timed)
  -> binary-size/readout and JSON serialization
```

The warm check is immediately after the cold check and before the release
build. This keeps release-link work from becoming an accidental input to the
warm signal. The warm command must have the same argument vector as the cold
command, including:

```text
cargo check --offline --locked -p <package> [--no-default-features]
```

The exact command is executed through the same normalized environment as the
cold command:

- `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is the existing run-owned check target directory allocated
  to this checkout outside the checkout itself;
- `CARGO_HOME` is the caller/workflow Cargo home, as for the cold check;
- `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`;
- `CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=0`;
- `CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0`;
- `RUSTC_WRAPPER` is unset.

The word *warm* refers only to reusing artifacts produced by the immediately
preceding cold check in that same per-checkout run-owned target directory. It
does not mean a shared target,
registry write, network request, changed source tree, or warm release link.
Current and baseline run-owned check target directories remain isolated even
when they share
`CARGO_HOME`; otherwise the comparison could measure cross-checkout cache
contamination rather than no-op behavior.

Before and after each checkout measurement, the harness records a source-state
fingerprint covering tracked content, tracked mode/type, symlink targets, and
untracked paths. The declared measurement output subtree (which the workflow
places under `output/compile-metrics/`) is excluded as harness-owned output;
target directories are outside the checkout. The output path must not alias a
tracked source path or a symlink into one. No other path is excluded. Any
difference fails the measurement and preserves the relevant log; it must not
produce a successful metrics JSON by pretending that the command was a no-op.

## 6. Metrics schema and identity

The V2 change extends the existing metrics payload; it does not redefine
existing cold fields.

### 6.1 V2 schema and backward compatibility

V2 metrics and comparison payloads carry `schema_version: 2`. The harness
always emits this version, including when warm measurement is disabled. The
gate may accept an unversioned legacy V1 cold-only payload for backward
compatibility only when no warm flag, warm field, warm row, or warm threshold
is requested; legacy artifacts must still satisfy the existing cold identity,
provenance, row, and arithmetic rules. A payload with an unknown version, or
any warm request against a payload without V2 fields, fails closed. Version is
a compatibility check, not a substitute for measurement identity.

### 6.2 Per-checkout metrics

Each `current.metrics.json` and `baseline.metrics.json` contains:

| Field | Type/condition | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | integer `2` for V2; omitted only by accepted legacy V1 cold-only artifacts | Payload contract version. |
| `cargo_check_seconds` | finite non-negative number | Existing cold check wall-clock duration. |
| `warm_check_enabled` | boolean | Whether the warm check was requested for this measurement. This is part of measurement identity. |
| `cargo_check_warm_seconds` | finite non-negative number when enabled; JSON `null` when disabled | Timed no-op check immediately following the cold check. `null`, not `0`, represents disabled measurement. |

For every V2 per-checkout payload, `warm_check_enabled` is present and a
boolean, and `cargo_check_warm_seconds` is present with the exact invariant
`false -> null` and `true -> finite, non-negative number`. A disabled result
must never use `0` as a sentinel, and an enabled result must never use `null`
or a missing field. The comparison envelope repeats the V2 version and must
bind its `current` and `baseline` payloads to those same field values.

All existing fields remain present and retain their current meaning, including
`package`, `binary`, `check_only`, `no_default_features`, `commit_oid`,
`package_count`, dependency-presence flags, release timing, and binary size.

### 6.3 Measurement identity

The identity used to compare current and baseline is extended from:

```text
package, binary, check_only, no_default_features
```

to:

```text
package, binary, check_only, no_default_features, warm_check_enabled
```

Current and baseline must match every field exactly. A warm-enabled current
measurement paired with a warm-disabled baseline is not comparable, even if
both payloads contain a numeric-looking field. Missing `warm_check_enabled` or
`cargo_check_warm_seconds` in a V2 warm comparison is a schema failure, not a
request to infer a default.

The identity bit prevents a false comparison between a cold-only run and a run
whose `cargo_check_seconds` was followed by a warm observation. It also keeps
future identity extensions explicit instead of relying on the presence of a
metric row as an implicit mode signal.

### 6.4 Comparison and summary

`comparison.json` retains the existing `measurement_identity` envelope and
includes the new `warm_check_enabled` field. The gate owns a static
schema-known metric set, independent of caller-selected thresholds:

```text
KNOWN_METRICS = {
  package_count,
  cargo_check_seconds,
  cargo_build_release_seconds,
  release_binary_bytes,
  cargo_check_warm_seconds,
}
```

Threshold flags form a separate optional `SELECTED_THRESHOLDS` subset of that
set. A threshold flag cannot make an otherwise unknown row supported, and the
absence of a threshold cannot make a known report-only row invalid. Every
`metric_rows` entry must name one static known metric at most once. When a
baseline exists, each row's `baseline` and `current` values must equal the
same-named numeric fields in the `baseline` and `current` payloads, including
the warm row; the gate must reject a row that disagrees with either payload or
uses a row to smuggle a value for a null/disabled field. `delta` and `percent`
remain derived values and must satisfy the existing arithmetic rules.

When a baseline exists and both measurements have warm mode enabled,
`metric_rows` includes exactly one warm row in addition to any other measured
known metrics:

```json
{
  "metric": "cargo_check_warm_seconds",
  "baseline": 0.0,
  "current": 0.0,
  "delta": 0.0,
  "percent": 0.0
}
```

The example values are illustrative only; real values must be finite and
non-negative. When warm mode is disabled, the per-checkout field is `null` and
no warm row is emitted. The summary reports whether warm measurement was
enabled and, when enabled, prints the current warm duration and the paired
comparison row where applicable. It must continue to label
`cargo_check_seconds` as **cold**.

## 7. Gate and threshold behavior

The existing cold gate remains authoritative and is evaluated exactly as it is
today. The warm metric is report-only unless the caller supplies
`--max-cargo-check-warm-regression-pct` (wired from the manual workflow input).

| Warm mode | Warm threshold | Baseline | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| disabled | empty | any | Existing cold/current-only behavior; no warm row. |
| enabled | empty | absent | Publish current warm report; no regression gate. |
| enabled | empty | present | Publish paired warm row; no warm threshold gate. |
| enabled | supplied | absent | Publish current warm report and emit an explicit no-baseline `SKIP` naming the warm threshold as not evaluated. |
| enabled | supplied | present | Validate and enforce the warm row using the existing regression formula. |
| disabled | supplied | any | Fail configuration closed; the supplied threshold has no valid measurement. |

Evaluation order is normative:

1. The unconditional workflow input validator runs first, including when no
   baseline is requested.
2. The gate validates the current payload and current side of the comparison
   envelope: accepted schema/version, current identity, current commit
   provenance, and V2 warm-field invariants. This stage does not require a
   paired comparison row.
3. If no baseline exists, emit the explicit current-only `SKIP` and summary
   wording, then stop. Do not enter paired row/percentage validation and do
   not require a baseline payload, warm row, or comparison row for this
   current-only result.
4. Only when a baseline exists does the gate validate the baseline payload and
   full identity/provenance match, then validate known metric rows and their
   payload bindings, followed by percentage arithmetic and selected
   thresholds. A missing warm row is rejected only in this baseline-present
   warm comparison path, never as part of the current-only `SKIP` path.

The warm threshold parser accepts only a finite, non-negative number. With a
baseline greater than zero, the percentage is:

```text
((current - baseline) / baseline) * 100
```

For `cargo_check_warm_seconds`, a zero baseline makes percentage evaluation
impossible. If no warm threshold is selected, the warm row is report-only and
may carry `percent: null`, rendered as `n/a`; the gate accepts that one
metric-specific non-evaluable result without inventing a percentage. If the
warm threshold is selected, the same zero-baseline row is a deterministic
failure because the requested threshold cannot be evaluated. Other known
metrics retain their existing percentage requirements unless a later,
metric-specific contract changes them.

For a baseline-present comparison, before threshold evaluation, the gate must
reject all of the following:

- missing or mismatched `measurement_identity`, including the warm bit;
- missing, duplicate, unsupported, or non-array `metric_rows` (support is the
  static known-metric set, not the selected threshold set);
- a missing warm row when baseline-present measurements both enable warm mode;
- non-finite, negative, or arithmetically inconsistent warm values;
- a row whose `baseline` or `current` value does not equal the corresponding
  payload field, or a warm row emitted for a disabled/null warm field;
- fabricated `delta` or `percent` values;
- stale or mismatched current/baseline commit provenance.

The workflow passes selected thresholds to the gate even when no baseline is
available, so the gate can emit the explicit current-only `SKIP`. The actual
regression gate remains non-blocking only for the absence of a baseline; input
validation and contradictory warm-mode configuration remain unconditional
failures.

The launcher-only `wasmtime` absence check and existing cold thresholds remain
unchanged. This slice does not add warm timing to required-gate or change the
required-gate planner's capability mapping.

## 8. Failure semantics and evidence

The harness and gate fail closed at the earliest point that makes the result
untrustworthy.

| Failure | Required behavior | Evidence boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cold check fails | Do not run or report a successful warm check. Return failure and preserve the cold log. | No metrics claim is valid. |
| Warm check fails | Return failure; do not fall back to `cargo_check_seconds` or emit a successful warm value. Preserve both check logs when available. | The run is incomplete, not a warm pass. |
| Warm check uses a different command, target, or environment | Contract test and implementation validation fail. | The result is not comparable. |
| Source/worktree fingerprint changes | Return failure and identify the changed checkout/path state. | No-op evidence is invalid. |
| Current/baseline identity mismatch | Abort comparison before threshold evaluation. | Existing cold rows must not mask the mismatch. |
| Warm row/schema/arithmetic is malformed | Gate returns deterministic failure. | Caller-authored or stale JSON cannot satisfy the gate. |
| Warm threshold supplied while warm mode is disabled, or any malformed threshold input | Unconditional workflow input validation fails before measurement/gate success. | No threshold is silently ignored. |
| Baseline fetch or ref resolution fails | Preserve existing baseline failure behavior; do not silently run a current-only result under a requested comparison. | No paired comparison exists. |
| No baseline requested | Publish current-only metrics and emit a visible gate `SKIP`; when a threshold was selected, name that threshold as not evaluated. | Current-only evidence is not a regression verdict. |

The workflow's `always()` summary/artifact steps may expose partial logs, but a
missing or incomplete summary is not a pass. Operators must inspect the first
measurement failure before debugging downstream summary or gate steps; a
missing `comparison.json` is normally a consequence, not the root failure.

## 9. Rollout and rollback

### Phase A: contract implementation behind an opt-in flag

Implement the CLI option, workflow inputs, schema fields, gate option, and
contract tests without changing default workflow triggers or cold thresholds.
Run current-only warm measurements to validate command identity and artifact
shape. This phase does not make a release or merge claim from a warm number.

### Phase B: paired report-only observation

Run the manual workflow with a fixed baseline ref and warm mode enabled across
the existing platform matrix and selected surfaces. Compare warm values only
within the same run's current/baseline identity and runner family. Collect
noise and failure signatures before choosing any threshold. Existing cold
regression results remain the primary gate.

### Phase C: explicit threshold trials

When an owner has a supported warm baseline and noise boundary, pass an
explicit warm threshold for a bounded manual run. A warm threshold is a real
gate for that invocation, but it is not a repository default and does not
change required-gate coverage. A threshold trial must be reviewed as a
measurement-policy decision by `qa_engineer`; repository health owns the
contract/documentation alignment, not release go/no-go.

### Rollback

Disable `measure_warm_check` and omit the warm threshold. The cold-only path
continues to provide the existing metrics and gate. A failed warm observation
does not justify weakening or removing the cold gate.

Automatic PR dispatch, multi-run statistical gating, fixed performance
hardware, and touched-source scenarios require separate scope and evidence.

## 10. Test strategy and acceptance

The implementation must extend
`scripts/ci-compile-metrics-contract.test.sh` without relying on absolute
timing expectations. The contract tests should assert invocation identity,
ordering, output schema, and fail-closed behavior using the existing fake Cargo
and Git surfaces.

Required cases:

1. **Default compatibility:** without `--measure-warm-check`, exactly one cold
   check is invoked; cold metrics, release behavior, and existing identity
   remain valid; warm mode is false and the warm duration is `null`.
2. **Legacy cold compatibility:** an unversioned V1 cold-only payload remains
   accepted only without warm fields, rows, or thresholds; a warm request or
   warm row against a legacy payload fails closed, while every new harness
   payload is explicitly V2.
3. **Warm check-only invocation and artifact reuse:** with the option, exactly
   two check calls occur; their command arguments are identical, both are
   `--offline --locked`, the second follows the first, and both use the same
   per-checkout run-owned target directory outside the checkout. Fake Cargo
   writes a marker into that target on the first check and requires the second
   check to observe it, proving artifact reuse rather than only path equality.
4. **Warm release invocation:** a release surface has two check calls in the
   same external per-checkout target, followed by the existing release build
   in a different external per-checkout target; the warm check does not become
   a release-build metric, and fake Cargo markers prove those targets differ.
5. **Environment normalization:** every current and baseline Cargo call,
   including both checks, records incremental/debug/wrapper values normalized
   exactly as the cold contract requires.
6. **Baseline isolation:** warm current and warm baseline checks each reuse
   only their own external per-checkout target; current and baseline targets
   remain distinct; the shared Cargo home behavior remains unchanged.
7. **Cold-failure short-circuit:** a fake Cargo failure on the first check
   prevents the warm check, release build, and successful warm JSON; the cold
   log is preserved.
8. **Warm-failure evidence:** a fake Cargo failure on the second check returns
   failure, prevents the release build and successful warm value, and preserves
   both check logs when available.
9. **No source mutation:** fake commands that change tracked content, mode,
   symlink state, or an untracked path cause deterministic measurement failure;
   unchanged state succeeds. Every mutation case runs only in a disposable
   measurement copy/worktree, removes that disposable worktree through Git
   before directory cleanup, and asserts that the canonical task worktree's
   source fingerprint is byte-for-byte unchanged.
10. **Output-path safety:** an output path equal to, inside, or symlinked into
    a tracked source path is rejected; an external output path succeeds. This
    test must not use the canonical task worktree as a mutation fixture.
11. **Schema, identity, and row binding:** V2 warm fields obey
    `false -> null` and `true -> finite non-negative`; current/baseline warm
    identity mismatches, missing or unknown schema versions, stale provenance,
    missing fields, and fabricated rows fail closed. A known report row whose
    values disagree with the corresponding current/baseline payload fields
    fails even when no threshold is selected, while unknown rows fail even if a
    threshold flag names them.
12. **Warm report-only and zero-baseline behavior:** enabled warm metrics with
    no warm threshold produce a report; a zero-baseline warm row renders
    `percent: null` as `n/a` and does not block. The same row with an explicit
    warm threshold fails closed.
13. **Workflow input validation and wiring:** the manual YAML declares a
    boolean warm opt-in defaulting false and an empty warm threshold default;
    an unconditional validator rejects malformed thresholds and
    threshold-with-warm-disabled regardless of baseline presence. Tests also
    prove the opt-in reaches current/baseline harness calls and the selected
    warm threshold reaches the gate.
14. **Visible no-baseline skip:** with a warm threshold and no baseline, the
    workflow first performs unconditional input and current-payload validation,
    then invokes the current-only gate path. The gate/summary visibly say
    `SKIP` and name the threshold as not evaluated before any paired
    row/percentage validation; no warm row is required without a baseline.
    This is not reported as a passing regression verdict. A baseline-present
    warm comparison separately rejects a missing warm row.
15. **Warm threshold behavior:** an explicit finite threshold passes within the
    threshold and fails above it; missing rows, malformed numbers, fabricated
    arithmetic, and invalid CLI thresholds fail closed according to Section 7.
16. **Summary labels:** summaries explicitly distinguish cold
    `cargo_check_seconds`, warm enabled/disabled state, warm duration, paired
    warm rows, zero-baseline `n/a`, and no-baseline threshold `SKIP`.
17. **Cold preservation:** the existing package, cold check, release, binary,
    launcher `wasmtime`, and no-baseline gate cases remain green.

Acceptance for this design slice is therefore:

- the opt-in contract and manual workflow surface are unambiguous;
- warm and cold command/external-target/environment identity is testable;
- the V2 JSON/summary/gate schema distinguishes warm-enabled from
  warm-disabled and remains explicit about accepted legacy cold payloads;
- static known metrics, selected thresholds, and row/payload binding are
  independent and fail closed when inconsistent;
- explicit warm threshold use cannot be silently ignored;
- no-baseline threshold handling is visibly `SKIP`, and zero-baseline
  report-only warm rows are metric-specific `n/a`;
- cold reproducibility and required-gate coverage are unchanged; and
- source mutation, identity drift, malformed payloads, and unavailable
  baselines fail closed.

The relevant local verification for the implementation phase is:

```bash
bash ./scripts/ci-compile-metrics-contract.test.sh
./scripts/doc-governance-check.sh
git diff --check
```

The first command is a future implementation contract for this design; the
documentation-only authoring slice need not claim that it passes until the
implementation exists.

## 11. Future touch-based incremental metrics

Warm/no-op is a prerequisite observation, not the final developer inner-loop
metric. A later Compile Metrics V2 slice may add these independent scenarios:

```text
cold-check
no-op-check
touch-proto
touch-node
touch-launcher-ui
touch-wasm-abi
```

Each touch scenario must use a clean, deterministic source fixture or copied
checkout, apply exactly one documented source mutation, and use its own
run-owned target directory outside the fixture checkout. It must not reuse the
no-op target or mutate the canonical task worktree. The fixture identity,
mutation kind, package/feature identity, target triple, toolchain, and source
commit must become explicit measurement identity fields before a touch result
can be compared.

Touch metrics need their own baseline/noise study and domain review. A
`touch-proto` or `touch-wasm-abi` contract may require the matching runtime or
WASM specialist to confirm that the fixture represents a meaningful boundary;
`qa_engineer` owns any decision to promote a touch threshold into a release or
required gate. No touch threshold, fixture, or automatic trigger is implied by
this warm/no-op design.

## 12. Residual risk and deferred-debt trigger

The warm signal still inherits hosted-runner CPU, filesystem, scheduler, and
Cargo metadata variance. The per-checkout run-owned target directory outside
the checkout is cold before the first check, but the Cargo registry/source
cache may be shared; the metric is therefore about the second check's no-op
path, not a hermetic machine benchmark.

Build scripts, environment changes, or toolchain behavior can invalidate
artifacts even when the source fingerprint is unchanged. That is useful
diagnostic information but does not make the metric a touched-source measure.
The existing three-platform workflow is also expensive, so this slice keeps
warm collection manual and opt-in.

Create a follow-up task when any of these triggers is observed:

- warm results are being used to support an incremental/touched-source claim;
- an owner wants a default warm threshold or required-gate enforcement;
- repeated platform-specific warm failures indicate runner or target
  contamination rather than source behavior;
- a source mutation is needed to represent a meaningful development loop; or
- enough paired samples exist to justify multi-run statistics, fixed runners,
  trend storage, or automatic changed-path dispatch.

Those triggers are technical-debt signals, not permission to broaden this
slice in place.
