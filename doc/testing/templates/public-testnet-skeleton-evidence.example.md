# Public Testnet Skeleton Evidence Example

审计轮次: example

## Purpose
- This template exists so repo-owned `network_tier_manifest` examples can point to a template-scoped evidence placeholder.
- It is intentionally a `skeleton` placeholder, not live `public_testnet` proof.

## Current Verdict
- `tier`: `public_testnet`
- `verdict`: `specified_skeleton_only`
- `claim_boundary`: `do_not_claim_live_public_testnet`

## What This File Does Not Prove
- It does not prove public RPC reachability.
- It does not prove explorer freshness.
- It does not prove guarded faucet enforcement.
- It does not prove reset-policy announcement or rehearsal.
- It does not prove `ready_for_live_candidate`.

## Upgrade Rule
- Replace this placeholder with real evidence before promoting any `public_testnet`
  manifest beyond `specified_skeleton_only`.
